Test if exist specific username for every case into localhost:  

* **get**: Get the value for every case from the configuration YAML file. This
action takes the value configured for every case from the config file. So, we
could had diferents values for every diferent case.

In this example we do not have global parameters and for every case we have
the next params: tt_members, tt_emails and username.
* **username**: this param has diferent value for every case so when we execute
every check this actions gets the value associated to every case.
