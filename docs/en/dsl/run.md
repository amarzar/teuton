# run

```
    run "id david"
```

* With this instruction we execute the commands on the local machine.
That is, where the `Teuton` program is running.

* In fact it's the same as doing `goto: localhost,: execute =>" id david "`.
Then why have another instruction? Because there are people who may like to do it this way.

# Ejemplos

Execute the command `id david` on the localhost:
* `run "id david"`
