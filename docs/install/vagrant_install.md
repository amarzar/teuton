* First, you must have `Vagrant` installed.
* Create directory for your vagrant project. For example, `mkdir teuton-vagrant`.
* Move into that directory: `cd teuton-vagrant`.
* Download required Vagrantfile:

| Vagrantfile        | URL |
| ------------------ | ----|
| T-Node OpenSUSE VM | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teuton-software/vagrant/master/t-node/opensuse/Vagrantfile |
| S-Node OpenSUSE VM | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teuton-software/vagrant/master/s-node/opensuse/Vagrantfile |

* Run `vagrant up` to run the Virtual Machine.

**Notice:** If you plan to build T-node and S-node VMs, then you need to use separated directories for every Vagranfile.

> There are more Vagrantfile files for others OS at https://github.com/teuton-software/vagrant/ repository.
